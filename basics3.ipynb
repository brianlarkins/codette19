    "In this lesson, we will learn how to use Python to work with information stored in files. Solving the world's problems requires having the right information at hand to make decisions. In our camp we will use data (information) that has been collected by other people and stored in special files that we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into data files, we need to understand a little bit about how Python can help use use and understand information. One of the ways to do this is to use the lists that we covered in Module 1 -- Another is to use *tuples* to group things and *dictionaries* to relate information together.\n",
